# DeepRL_DQN_tensorflow
A repository of Q-learning based Deep Reinforcement learning algorithms, including Linear DQN, DQN with experience reply, Dueling DQN and Double Dueling DQN. Tested on Tensorflow + Gym.

Implemented algorithms: 

1) Linear Q network without experience replay
2) Linear Q network with experience replay
3) Deep D-network (DQN) with experience replay and target network
4) Dueling DQN with experience replay
5) Double Dueling DQN with conv layers, specially tweaked for playing Space_Invaders_v0
